              5.1. Alliance-Fx Market recognizes that the USA PATRIOT Act, as
              amended from time to time (the “Act”), imposes important
              obligations on all financial firms for the detection, deterrence,
              and reporting of money laundering activities. Under the Act, money
              laundering is defined as any financial transaction using income
              derived from criminal activity including, but not limited to, drug
              trafficking, fraud, illegal gambling, and terrorism. Alliance-Fx
              Market has established the following policies to ensure compliance
              with all laws and regulations regarding money laundering. 5.2.
              Prior to the opening of any new Trading Account, Alliance-Fx
              Market will document the identity, nature of business, income, the
              source of funds, and investment objectives of each prospective
              customer. Therefore, Alliance-Fx Market will request the
              Customer’s driver’s license number, passport number and may
              request copies of the Customer’s identifying documents. 5.3. On an
              on-going basis, Alliance-Fx Market will review Trading Account
              activity for evidence of transactions that may be indicative of
              money laundering activities. This review may include surveillance
              of: (a) money flows into and out of Trading Accounts, (b) the
              origin and destination of wire transfers, (c) non-economic
              transactions, and (d) other activity outside the normal course of
              business. Every officer, employee and associated person of
              Alliance-Fx Market is responsible for assisting in the firm’s
              efforts to uncover and report any activity that might constitute,
              or otherwise indicate or raise suspicions of, money laundering. To
              this end, Alliance-Fx Market provides continuing education and
              training of all such persons. 5.4. Alliance-Fx Market will comply
              with all trade and economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. Office
              of Foreign Assets Control against targeted foreign countries and
              shall cooperate fully with government agencies, self-regulatory
              organisations, and law enforcement officials. As provided by the
              Act, Alliance-Fx Market may supply information about former,
              current or prospective customers to such bodies.

              6.1 All amounts handed over by the Client to the Company or which
              the Company holds on behalf of the Client, for the provision of
              Investment Services as in paragraph 2, shall be held in the name
              of the Client and/or in the name of the Company on behalf of the
              Client in an account with any bank, other institution or any
              electronic payment providers/processors used to accept funds which
              the Company shall specify from time to time (“the ‘Bank Account’).
              6.2 The Client has the right to withdraw the funds, which are not
              used for margin covering, free from any obligations from his
              sub-account without closing the said sub-account. 6.3 Money
              transfer request (withdrawal from the trading account) is
              processed within three working days after receiving from the
              Client transfer request instructions. Then the transferring amount
              reduces the balance of the Client’s sub-account when the transfer
              request process is concluded. The Company reserves the right to
              decline a withdrawal request if the request is not in accordance
              with paragraph 7.9 or delay the processing of the request if not
              satisfied on full documentation of the Client. 6.4 The Client
              agrees to pay any incurred bank transfer fees/charges charged by
              the Bank Account providers, the Company or any other intermediary
              involved in such transaction process when withdrawing funds from
              his sub-account to his designated account held in any of the
              providers specified in paragraph 7.1 above. The Client is fully
              responsible for payments details, given to the Company and the
              Company accepts no responsibility for the Client’s funds, if the
              Client’s given details are wrong. 6.5 The Client agrees that any
              amounts sent by the Client or on the Client’s behalf in the Bank
              Accounts, will be deposited (credited) to the Client’s trading
              account at the value date of the payment received and net of any
              charges / fees charged by the Bank Account providers, the Company
              or any other intermediary involved in such transaction process.
              The Company must be satisfied that the sender is the Client or an
              authorized representative of the Client before making any amount
              available to the Client’s trading account, otherwise, the Company
              reserves the right to refund/send back the net amount credited to
              the account by the same method as received. It is also understood
              that the Company accepts no responsibility for any funds not
              deposited directly into Company’s bank accounts.
